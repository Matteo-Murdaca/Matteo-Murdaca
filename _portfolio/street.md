It's a strange sensation, I mean, it could seem a quite normal thing to take a camera, go in a different city and be ready to capture an instant, an instant of daily life.
Well, I find it strange but I also love doing it so...
Here there are some of my experiments with this thing, some of my experiments trying to write a storybook with a camera and some light.
