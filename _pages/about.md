How to describe myself in a few words?

I would start by stating that I'm an Italian student currently in my fourth and final year of high school.

I could also say that while I am pursuing a social science-based curriculum, I'll probably be starting my major in physics next year, de facto moving from a social science field to a STEM one.

Why the strange move? You might ask.

The reason is easy: my interests vary a lot, and with a lot I really mean A LOT!

While I love studying the social sciences (expecially sociology and economics), I also have a soft spot for computer science, physics and math; in fact, I am a sort of Frankenstein between an aspiring physicist and an aspiring economist with a strong love for good music and philosophy.

Just because I have too much free time left, I make videos for Liberi Oltre and love taking various pictures (as you can see in my portfolio).
